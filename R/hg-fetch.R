#' Haida Gwaii Fetch
#'
#' Downloads and binds the eight fetch datasets from \url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebdalgarno/haidawave-data/master/}.
#'
#' Points were generated within a GIS spaced 10m along 1:50,000 ShoreZone vector coastline data (Howes et al. 1994).
#' From each point, fetch distance (i.e. distance from point to nearest ShoreZone coastline) was calculated at 5 degree intervals using
#' the java-based software - 'Vector_fetch' - developed by Mika Murtojarvi (Murtojarvi et al. 2007).
#' Since ShoreZone vector coastline data were limited to BC, fetch distances are only accurate to 200,000 m.
